    "Being able to process volumetric data is a necessity in medical image analysis. Most medical data is in fact volumetric. CT scans, MRI, PET, SPECT and even ultrasound are producing 3D data which contain several million voxels (3D pixels) per scan. Although this type of data is extremely useful for diagnosis, as it reflects the true patient 3D anatomical configuration, dealing with such dimensionality can be challenging from a computational standpoint. In particular, neural networks which need to be trained on this kind of data suffer from the computational challenges brought by the amount of information in these scans. Recent advancements in both GPU computing capabilities, research [Ref. 1] and deep learning software have made the application of 3D-CNNs to 3D data possible. Large GPU memory sizes, the availability of accelerated software routines for 3D convolution, deconvolution and pooling as well as theoretical imporvements such as the introduction of Dice loss, group normalization, skip connections and encoder-decoder architectures have enabled interesting advancements in this field. \n",

    "The dice coefficient measures the overlap between two (binary) contours and has been generalized and introduced as an objective function for FCNNs in [Ref. 3]. Since then it has been utilized in a number of scientific works and it is now very well established. The formulation used in this work is DICE=2 * (Gt * Pred) / (Gt^2 + Pred^2). This corresponds to Dice when both Gt and Pred are binary.\n",

    "## The importance of skip connections in biomedical image segmentation\n",
    "In a medical segmentation task, we want to map every voxel location of a medical image to a distinct class value representing for example background or organ of interest. Consequently, the input (image) and the output (segmentation) usually have the same spatial extent. A straight-forward approach to design a neural network architecture to achieve this goal would be to have several fully connected layers without changing the spatial dimensionality. However, this approach would very quickly lead to an explosion in terms of number of parameters. Convolutional operations have the advantage to significantly reduce the number of parameters, as the same operation is applied in strides over the entire image. Furthermore they are invariant to translation, e.g. it is not important if the object of interest is shifted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Designing a fully convolutional network without reducing the spatial dimensions would be possible, but research indicates that a encoder-decoder network is more effective [Ref. 6]. An encoder-decoder network typically looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Encoder-Decoder Network](encoder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The contracting path (Encoder) maps the image to a feature representation that is often lower dimensional than the original input size. The expanding path (Decoder) maps the feature representation to the output space. Originally, this type of network was known in connection with auto-encoder, where the output space is the same as the input space. In case of segmentation the output space often has the same spatial extend as the input space, but represents different content (classes). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the downsampling in the contracting path, fewer parameters need to be trained. However, this comes at the cost of losing spatial information. One approach to counteract this is the use of so-called skip connections: allowing the gradient to skip part of the network and to flow directly from a layer of the contracting part to the expanding path.

    "Structuring code to solve a machine learning problem to ensure both flexibility and adoption of best practices is not an easy task. In this exercise we try to incorporate some of the best principles that have emerged in popular recent python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of modern frameworks such as tensorflow and pytorch, most of the processes around developement of DL approaches have been standardized. During developement of a typical project it is necessary to take care of only a handful of compartimentalized tasks such as:\n",
    "* DATA\n",

    "    2. Split dataset into batches and iterate through them\n",

    "### Handling Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For **data** handling we define transforms in charge of loading, standardizing and modifying the dataset. Our transforms are chainable (stackable) such that data handling pipelines can be created. The dataset is stored in a python **dictionary** in order to allow this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transforms** are implemented by classes. In the constructor of these transforms (`__init__` method in python) we pass the parameters of the transform. We define the `__call__` method to accept only one user defined argument which is the dictionary containing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ExampleTransform(object):\n",
    "    # this transformation adds a constant to the images of a dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, constant):\n",
    "        # the constant that we add is passed as a parameter of this transform \n",
    "        self.constant = constant\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def __call__(self, data):\n",
    "        # data is a dictionary containing the dataset. we suppose it has a field 'images'\n",
    "        data['images'] = data['images'] + self.constant\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # the modified version of the data dictionary is returned as a result of the transform\n",
    "        return data \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The example code above implements a simple transform that adds a constant to all of the images of the dataset. Other transforms, including those aiming at loading datasets from filesystem and actually inject new data into the 'data' dictionary can be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to split the dataset into batches and iterate through these batches during training validation and potentially testing we need a batch iterator. This is implemented here through a python class which acts as a generator. That is, we can use our batch iterator object in a for loop to get batches that we can use during training. The batch iterator will return a dictionary containing data at each iteration. The batch iterator is also able to execute tranforms (as defined above) both before and during iterating over the dataset. More details will be shown later in the exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Network definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections of this exercise you will find the implementation of the network object in pytorch. A few network block objects have been defined in order to break down the implementation in more manageable portions and group together code that can be re-used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss layers can be defined very easily in pytroch by implementing only the 'forward' computation of the loss and omitting the gradient implementation. This is possible thanks to the built-in automatic differentiation capabilities of pytorch and other modern DL frameworks.\n",

The basic functionality of this code is to instantiate the network layers (init), the network forward computation function (forward member function), and finally instantiate batch iterators and optimizer.  \n",

    "### BatchNorm / GroupNorm\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing the data as it passes through the network provides two main advantages. First, it keeps the values during training centered near 0, which is where activation functions are most nonlinear and hence most sensitive. Second, it introduces some noise, as the renormalizing procedure varies between images and discards a small amount of information. The addition of noise makes the network more robust and less likely to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are multiple types of normalization available. A conventional choice is BatchNorm. In this method, for a single channel (the output of a particular convolution kernel from a previous layer), the mean and standard deviation of all pixel values in the channel are computed across an entire batch. The mean is subtracted from each pixel value, centering them at zero, and then they are scaled by the standard deviation, giving the new data mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Finally, every value is re-scaled by a single, trainable weight, and shifted by a trainable bias. For example, in a batch of 20 100x100 RGB images, the 20x100x100 = 200,000 red pixel values would be grouped together, as would the 200,000 green and blue values, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of this method is that when we deploy our model, the statistics of a single image are non-existent, so a running average must be computed during training. Similarly, if the model or input is large, the batch size may be small, again reducing the statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to these disadvantages is found in the GroupNorm. The procedure is quite similar, but the statistics are only computed for a single image at a time. To improve statistical power, multiple channels are grouped together instead. This leaves us without the problems on small batches or at deployment. In the example above, the RGB images of size 100x100, regardless of batch size, 3x100x100 = 30,000 values would be normalized together."

    "## Implementation of training + validation loops\n",
    "We implement here the training and validation loops. The training loop implements a cycle over the batches that can be obtained from the training set and feeds them to the network. After the forward propagation, gradients are backpropagated so that the parameters of the networks can be updated and training can take place. One thing that is very convenient in PyTorch is the ability to update the parameters of the network once every multiple batches. This is particularly useful in situation, such as the current one, where due to GPU memory constraints it is not possible to use large batch sizes during training (here we use batch size two, resulting in almost full usage of 16 GB of GPU memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation loop feeds data to the network and executes the forward propagation step. With the directive `net_seg.eval()` we instruct pytorch to put the network in evaluation mode (as opposed to training mode) and `with torch.no_grad():` we are asking pytorch not to allocate memory for gradient as we won't need to compute any during validation.\n",

V-Net is one of the first works proposing 3D segmentation and is the first work that introduced Dice loss as an objective function that can be optimized to deliver superior segmentation performance. Dice loss is the objective function of choice for medical image segmentation and has been undes by hundreds of groups worldwide. Network architecture derived from V-Net and further improving it have been also developed and have been applied to a multitude of tasks and a wide range of anatomies. \n",

    "In this lab we have shown the details of how to achieve an improved implementation of V-Net by using modern DL software and advanced python design constructs. By trying your own experiments you should be also able to further explore the effect of specific design choices on the outcome of the experiments and performance of the network. \n",

    "Despite the slow training procedure, due to the high computational load of the task presented in this lab, the network starts showing signs of convergence within 50 epochs. In reality, such a network would need to be trained for much longer periods of time, amounting to days or even weeks (depending on the dataset) on modern GPUs. "
